1. Create **Windows Live ID** account for [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) if you do not have already
1. **Register your site** in [Windows Live Application Management](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index) that WordPress could connect to your OneDrive. 
1. Set **Redirect URL** in Windows Live Application as shown in plugin configuration.
It should look like this: 
`http://yourdomain.com/path-to-wordpress/wp-content/pwebonedrive/callback.php`
or if  you have enabled Permalinks in WordPress Settings then it should look like this: 
`http://yourdomain.com/path-to-wordpress/pwebonedrive/callback` 
1. Set **Mobile client app: No** in Windows Live Application.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[Visit full documentation page](http://www.perfect-web.co/wordpress/microsoft-onedrive-gallery-file/documentation)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= First use of OneDrive buttons =

Disable pop-up windows blocking, because OneDrive would display login and permissions screen in a new pop-up window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= Change size of thumbnails in gallery =

OneDrive offers only two sizes of thumbnails.
To change it, add to your shortcode a following attribute:
`[onedrivegallery id="..." thumbnail="thumbnail"]`
Default thumbnail size is:
`[onedrivegallery id="..." thumbnail="album"]`

You can also change size of lightbox image, by adding to your shortcode a following attribute:
`[onedrivegallery id="..." full="full"]`
Default lightbox image size is:
`[onedrivegallery id="..." full="normal"]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= Blank Lightbox or error =

If you clicked OneDrive button in editor and nothing has happened after a few minutes or a blank Lightbox window has display with message: Error Microsoft OneDrive, then remove cookie named: wl_auth and reload post edit page.

Use OneDrive emergency exit button to close all blank layers.

Remember to save post before using OneDrive buttons or at least before reloading page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= Error in Microsoft popup =

Since plugin version 1.1.0 there is a new Redirect URL. Make sure you have updated it! You can also enable **Enhanced redirection security** in old Windows Live applications - created before June 2014.

Each time you would **enable / disable WordPress Permalinks Settings**, Redirect URL will change and you will have to **update** it in **Windows Live Application**. Make sure that it is up to date.

If you got message: *Microsoft account is experiencing technical problems* in popup window then check **error_description** of URL in address bar.

If you have following error description:
*The provided value for the input parameter 'redirect_uri' is not valid. The expected value is 'https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf' or a URL which matches the redirect URI registered for this client application*
then make sure that you have plugin version 1.1.0 or newer 
and you have set the same **Redirect URL** in Windows Live application management as in plugin configuration.

Make sure that if you have set in Windows Live application management **redirect URL with www** then you access back-end and front-end site also with www otherwise it would not work.
If it is possible to access your site with and without www then you should correct it in .htaccess file and allow only one way.

If you have other error description then send it to our support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= Debugging =

Enable debug in WordPress - [read how to](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress).

Go to Post editor. 
Remove **wl_auth cookie**. 
Reload page. 
Try to use OneDrive button again. 
You will see some alerts with debug informations.

Check also `/wp-content/debug.log` file. Read only lines with *pweb_onedrive* or *LiveConnectClient*.
If you would not find there any error message then send this log file to our support.
